### What is the most fascinating thing you've learned in the past month?
As a new parent, I've enjoyed changing diapers, learning all the lyrics to "Here Comes Stompy the Bear" and finding new ways to stoke and explore my intellectual curiosity. Through deep diving into evolutionary psychology, I have both grown as a parent to understand the needs of my baby, and kept my brain stimulated with an answer to this age old question: “why won’t my toddler eat anything other than mashed potatoes?” From my research, I learned that an infant’s preference for sweetness and many toddlers’ preference for bland, familiar foods may have been born out of a prehistoric world that required these traits to survive. In a world where a nomadic community cannot predict when their next meal may be, calorie-rich foods that travel relatively well (e.g., berries, bananas, apples) were essential to survival. Babies, dependent on their caregivers for all their needs - from being carried to being fed - preferred these foods while growing rapidly in their first year. Similarly, when prehistoric children were likely to start walking on their own, the children who survived the dangers of roaming through a fruit-filled forest were likely those who avoided unknown berries and stuck to the few foods that had already been deemed safe. This awareness of our early preferences and understanding of why toddlers, even those who were adventurous eaters at the age of one, may settle into a picky-phase around the age of two will undoubtedly make those evenings at the dinner table more enjoyable for everyone. A two-year-old isn’t trying to be difficult, they're simply in an ingrained phase that will pass with time.

### What do you want to be doing in two years?
I’m fascinated by the insights-driven by  (and unforeseen externalities of) machine learning. During the five years I worked in marketing, I consistently sought ways to manipulate marketing data to ensure teams made the most of the core business analytics, even leveraging machine learning algorithms like k-clusters. Additionally, as an individual who strives to do more good than harm in the world, I seek to leverage machine learning concepts to uncover potential solutions to complicated systemic challenges, like the ever-growing “achievement gap” in the US’ K12 education system or identifying practices that are most likely to lead to environmentally sound behavior change at a systems level. However, I also get an incredible sense of satisfaction when building a program from scratch. From breaking problems into manageable parts, to learning a new set of built-in functions that can make execution easier, I’ve enjoyed stretching the limit of my understanding, seeking guidance from programmer friends and experimenting with different approaches to solve a problem. This leaves me with two possible professional directions. But, despite the direction, in the next two years, I want to be doing something that challenges me intellectually on a regular basis, inspires continual learning, and contributes to a greater cause and team.

### Why do you want to attend RC? How would attending RC be different than working on your own?
RC is the embodiment of my greatest love within learning - the role of student/teacher. I am deeply curious and keen to self-teach and build continual momentum, while just as importantly, learning from a brilliant and diverse community of fellow “forever-learners” eager to learn from one another. Many of the things I enjoy doing, I’ve fostered simply by following my curiosity, whether that’s exploring new areas of behavior economics, manipulating images with Photoshop, or writing tunes on the guitar. RC’s focus on self-directed learning means I can grow as a programmer by following my curiosity, while learning in a safe space to challenge myself to the fullest extent. RC isn’t a classroom, it is a community where learning and teaching work in harmony; a community I hope to join and grow.

### What would you like to work on at RC?
I see two directions for myself, within the world of coding — data science vs. backend computer science. Both pique my interest - I frequently daydream about the powerful insights that could be identified by applying machine learning algorithms to publicly-available K12 data or the financial benefits of a program that could help consumers identify cheaper investment alternatives to costly, bank-managed mutual funds. If I were to join the RC community, my first step would be to learn from those with more experience in each of these fields of science, mainly turning to alumni, fellow RC members and current batch-mates, with the goal of better understanding their day-to-day programming life and the types of problems they work on. Once I’ve chosen to move forward with a focus in one of these fields, I’d develop a series of projects to pursue, with the goals to hone my coding language fluency and bring to life one of those daydreams mentioned above. Given I tend to learn better when I learn collaboratively and on a greater project or goal of interest, I’d then hope to bring together a small team of fellow RC-ers to work on a project, turn to the team (and those outside of the team) for frequent feedback and guidance when a next step isn’t clear, iterate on the project, and continuously evolve and enhance until we feel like we’ve learned as much as we can from a project. After completing a three to four one-week long “sprint projects'', each of which would focus on either learning a different machine learning algorithm or a different programming concept or system, we’d then turn our attention to “capstone,” focusing on K12 education in the US or working on a program that helps individual investors build financial literacy through the creation of individualized portfolios of ETFs comparable to popular (and expensive) mutual funds. Through these group projects, collaborative learning and exploring new methodologies, I would grow as a professional and community member.

## Background

### Describe your programming background in a few sentences.
I learned R in undergrad while studying Mathematics, where R was mainly used for statistical analysis and economics. After graduating from undergrad, I did not touch R until grad school, where I re-learned the basics of R to help with data cleaning for University of Michigan’s School of Social Work. Every job I’ve had since graduating from grad school I’ve tried to find some way to incorporate R, and have since begun teaching myself Python.

### Have you worked professionally as a programmer?
“Programmer,” has never been part of my job title or job description, although I’ve often found ways to weave programming into my jobs and responsibilities.

### Do you have a Computer Science degree or are you seeking one?
I do not and am not, but do have an undergraduate degree in Mathematics.
What other commitments (work, life, family) would you have during your batch?
I’m the father of a wonderful 7-month-old, and between daycare and the help of my incredibly supportive partner, I’ve been able to dedicate 9am to 4pm every day for the last month to coding, and we expect this to remain possible going forward.
